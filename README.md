# NumberGame
In this game:
The program generates a random number between 1 to 100 inclusive.
The player is prompted to guess the number.
After each guess, the program provides feedback ("Too high", "Too low", or "Correct!").
The game continues until the player guesses the correct number and it also includes the attempts.
